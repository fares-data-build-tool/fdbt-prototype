      <p>
        Going forwards the new prototype will be versioned; changes will be made as research is gathered and once enough research is gathered a new version will be created. Outside of this versions maybe created to test different flows or A â€“ B testing with different interactions.
        <p>
          All new prottypes will be created with the GDS prototyping toolkit from the from July 10th 2020

        Prototypes for the service up until 10 July 2020 have been built in sketch and prototyped with invision this process has was done throughout alpha stage.

        The development has been built in a modular way and the flow put together as the modular elements became complete. The current development prototypes can be found on the link below. You will need to register and also will be asked fro a NOC code, please enter WBTR in that field.
